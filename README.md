# SourceMod Spray Manager

Current Release: 1.4.2 (17/09/2015)
Project Page: http://monsterprojects.org/projects/spray-manager

SprayManager is a simple spray tracking plugin that allows you to do 3 main things:
* View player sprays in the MOTD
* Remove player sprays from the map
* Block a specific player spray from use. 

Each spray is tracked individually, so if the player gets a new spray their old spray details are still stored and their new spray details will be added.

## SourceIRC Plugin

I also created a module for the sourcemod IRC relay plugin [SourceIRC](https://github.com/Azelphur/SourceIRC) by [Azelphur](https://github.com/Azelphur), this adds commands that can be used from IRC.
